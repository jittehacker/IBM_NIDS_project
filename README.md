# IBM AI & Cloud Internship Project

Welcome to the official repository for my IBM AI & Cloud Internship project. This repository showcases my hands-on work with IBM Cloud services, AutoAI, and machine learning model deployment. It includes documentation of my internship journey and the Snap Decision Tree Classifier model generated using IBM AutoAI.

## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of my internship with IBM, focusing on cloud-native AI solutions. The goal was to explore IBM Cloud capabilities, automate model generation using AutoAI, and prepare the model for scalable deployment.

### Contents:
- `IBM_AI_Cloud_Internship_Project.pdf`: A comprehensive report detailing the objectives, methodology, and outcomes of the internship.
- `_P2 - Snap Decision Tree Classifier.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook containing the AutoAI-generated model pipeline, including preprocessing steps, model training, and evaluation metrics.

## Model Summary

- **Model Type**: Decision Tree Classifier
- **Generated By**: IBM AutoAI
- **Pipeline ID**: P2
- **Features Used**: Automatically selected and transformed by AutoAI
- **Performance Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score (see notebook for details)

## IBM Cloud Services Used

- IBM AutoAI
- IBM Watson Studio
